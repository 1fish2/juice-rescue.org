## About Juice Rescue

Now that Enel X is shutting down key infrastructure for these devices, Juice Rescue is organizing a collective effort aimed at:

* Educating people about how to safely keep charging with your Juicebox charger  
* Organizing technology development on projects like [Juicepassproxy](https://github.com/JuiceboxRescue/juicepassproxy) that can replace some of the functionality of the apps that are shutting down  
* Coordinating efforts across customers and clients of Enel X to:  
  * Advocate that Enel X release Juicebox-related intellectual property and source code that would   
  * Direct public pressure, policy, and legal strategies that could help Enel X meet its promises to customers/clients, and its obligations under the law, including right to repair laws

## Juicebox FAQ

**Will my Juicebox shut down on Ocober 11?** Residential juiceboxes will continue to work however they were configured when the system goes down, even after the apps are no longer available. Commercial users and those with special deals with power companies may not be able to charge- please contact your power company or commercial operator with questions.

**Will the Juicebox become a fire hazard?** It depends. If your power supply is rated for fewer amps than the rating of the juicebox, it‚Äôs very important for you to configure the charger to an appropriate level before October 11\. Otherwise the charger will get stuck drawing more amps than your system can provide. 

**About us**
